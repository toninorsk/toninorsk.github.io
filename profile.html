    <p class="header-paragraph">
      <em>Ratchaburi</em> province is a medium-sized province with an area of
      about 5,196 square kilometres (2,006 sq mi). The eastern part of the
      province contains the flat river plains of the Mae Klong, crisscrossed by
      many khlongs. The most famous tourist spot in this area is the Damnoen
      Saduak Floating Market. The west of the province is more mountainous, and
      includes the Tenasserim Hills. As the mountains are made mostly of
      limestone, there are several caves containing stalactites. Some caves are
      inhabited by large colonies of bats, and it is an impressive sight when
      they swarm out in the evening to feed. Other caves like the Khao Bin are
      accessible for visitors. The main river of the western part is the Phachi
      River. On the left bank of the Phachi is the Chaloem Phrakiat Thai Prachan
      National Park. The area of <em>Ratchaburi</em> province is divided into
      three parts. First, the border in the west which is shared with Myanmar
      and is about 60 kilometres (37 mi) long. The second contains the
      Tenasserim mountains and forests with an elevation of about 200 - 300
      meters. The central area of the province is rich in wetlands due to river
      flow. <em>Ratchaburi</em> has important natural resources in its forest of
      which it covers an area of 1,711 km2 (661 sq mi) or 33 percent of
      provincial area.[5] Moreover, it has minerals such as tin, tantalum,
